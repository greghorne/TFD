# TFD

Display the latest Tulsa Fire Department incident on a map.

* Tech Stack: Leaflet, HTML, JS, CSS

Place index.html, tfd.js and tfd.css into the same folder and open index.html in a browser.

I have added code for using indexedDB that is currently merely adding the latest incident after each poll of the json file.

I will have to think of a reason to use the data.
