# TFD

Display the latest Tulsa Fire Department incident on a map.

* Tech Stack: Leaflet & Javascript

* Place index.html, tfd.js and tfd.css into the same folder and open index.html in a browser.

* I have added code for using indexedDB that is currently merely adding the latest incident after each poll of the json file.  Currrently the DB is not being used.
